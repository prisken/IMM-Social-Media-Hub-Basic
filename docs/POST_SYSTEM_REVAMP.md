# Post Creation System Revamp - Organization Isolation Fix

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive revamp of the post creation system to ensure proper organization-sensitive database structure and isolation.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
- **Problem**: Organization-specific database schema in `main.ts` was missing `organization_id` columns
- **Impact**: Posts, categories, and media files were not properly isolated by organization
- **Solution**: Updated organization database schema to include `organization_id` columns in all relevant tables

### 2. Inconsistent Organization Isolation
- **Problem**: DatabaseService expected organization_id but organization database tables didn't have this column
- **Impact**: Data leakage between organizations
- **Solution**: Updated all database operations to include organization_id filtering

### 3. Post Creation Flow Issues
- **Problem**: Post creation didn't properly handle organization isolation
- **Impact**: Posts could be created without proper organization context
- **Solution**: Fixed post creation flow to ensure organizationId is properly set

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`electron/main.ts`)

#### Updated Organization Database Tables
```sql
-- Added organization_id to all relevant tables
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS categories (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ADDED
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ADDED
  category_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  topic_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- ... other fields
  FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Similar updates for media_files, calendar_events, post_templates
```

#### Added Indexes and Triggers
- Added organization-specific indexes for better performance
- Added triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- Ensured proper foreign key relationships

### 2. DatabaseService Updates (`src/services/database/DatabaseService.ts`)

#### Organization-Aware Operations
- **Categories**: All operations now filter by `organization_id`
- **Posts**: All operations now filter by `organization_id`
- **Media Files**: All operations now filter by `organization_id`
- **Calendar Events**: All operations now filter by `organization_id`
- **Post Templates**: All operations now filter by `organization_id`

#### Key Changes
```typescript
// Before
async getCategories(): Promise<Category[]> {
  const rows = await this.query('SELECT * FROM categories ORDER BY name')
  // ...
}

// After
async getCategories(): Promise<Category[]> {
  const rows = await this.query('SELECT * FROM categories WHERE organization_id = ? ORDER BY name', [this.organizationId])
  // ...
}
```

### 3. ApiService Updates (`src/services/ApiService.ts`)

#### Simplified Organization Handling
- Removed redundant organizationId parameters from DatabaseService calls
- DatabaseService now handles organization isolation internally
- ApiService focuses on business logic while DatabaseService handles data isolation

### 4. AuthService Updates (`src/services/AuthService.ts`)

#### Database Service Initialization
- Added proper database service initialization when switching organizations
- Ensures ApiService and DatabaseService are properly configured with organization context
- Maintains organization isolation across authentication state changes

```typescript
// Initialize database service with organization ID
await databaseService.initializeDatabase(organizationId)
apiService.setOrganizationId(organizationId)
```

### 5. PostForm Component Updates (`src/components/PostEditor/PostForm.tsx`)

#### Proper Organization Context
- Ensures `organizationId` is included in post creation data
- Maintains organization context throughout the post creation flow

```typescript
const postData = {
  ...data,
  organizationId: organization!.id,  // ADDED
  hashtags,
  media: mediaFiles
}
```

### 6. PostList Component Updates (`src/components/PostEditor/PostList.tsx`)

#### Improved Post Duplication
- Fixed post duplication to properly handle organization context
- Ensures duplicated posts maintain proper organization isolation

## Database Structure

### Organization Isolation Architecture
```
Global Database (global.db)
├── users
├── organizations  
└── user_organizations

Organization-Specific Database (organizations/{orgId}/database.db)
├── categories (with organization_id)
├── topics (with category_id)
├── posts (with organization_id, category_id, topic_id)
├── media_files (with organization_id)
├── post_media (with post_id, media_file_id)
├── calendar_events (with organization_id, post_id)
└── post_templates (with organization_id)
```

### Key Relationships
- **Users** → **Organizations** (many-to-many via user_organizations)
- **Organizations** → **Categories** (one-to-many)
- **Categories** → **Topics** (one-to-many)
- **Organizations** → **Posts** (one-to-many)
- **Posts** → **Media Files** (many-to-many via post_media)
- **Organizations** → **Calendar Events** (one-to-many)
- **Organizations** → **Post Templates** (one-to-many)

## Testing

### Test Scenarios Created
1. **Organization A - Create Category**: Verify category creation in Organization A
2. **Organization B - Create Category**: Verify category creation in Organization B
3. **Organization A - Create Post**: Verify post creation in Organization A
4. **Organization B - Create Post**: Verify post creation in Organization B
5. **Organization A - Verify Isolation**: Verify Organization A only sees its own data
6. **Organization B - Verify Isolation**: Verify Organization B only sees its own data

### Key Verification Points
- Posts created in Organization A should not appear in Organization B
- Categories created in Organization A should not appear in Organization B
- Media files should be isolated by organization
- Database queries should respect organization boundaries
- Organization switching should properly initialize database service

## Benefits

### 1. Data Isolation
- Complete separation of data between organizations
- No data leakage between different organization contexts
- Proper multi-tenant architecture

### 2. Performance
- Organization-specific indexes for faster queries
- Reduced query complexity with proper filtering
- Optimized database operations

### 3. Security
- Organization-level access control
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Data integrity maintained across operations

### 4. Scalability
- Each organization has its own database file
- Easy to backup/restore individual organizations
- Horizontal scaling possible

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data
- Existing organization databases will need to be recreated with the new schema
- The new schema includes `organization_id` columns that weren't present before
- All existing data will be properly isolated once migrated

### For New Organizations
- New organizations will automatically get the correct schema
- All operations will be properly isolated from the start
- No additional configuration required

## Conclusion

The post creation system has been completely revamped to ensure proper organization isolation. All database operations now respect organization boundaries, and the system maintains data integrity across organization switches. The architecture is now properly multi-tenant and ready for production use.

### Key Improvements
✅ **Fixed database schema mismatch**
✅ **Implemented proper organization isolation**
✅ **Updated all database operations**
✅ **Fixed post creation flow**
✅ **Added comprehensive testing scenarios**
✅ **Maintained backward compatibility where possible**

The system is now ready for testing and production deployment with proper organization-sensitive database structure.
