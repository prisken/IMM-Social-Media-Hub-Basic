# Database Refactor Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive database refactor performed on the Social Media Management application. The refactor addresses schema inconsistencies, improves data relationships, and adds missing functionality.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Organizations Table
- ✅ Added missing fields: `description`, `website`, `logo`
- ✅ Updated `settings` field with proper default value
- ✅ Improved data consistency

#### Posts Table
- ✅ Removed `media` JSON column (replaced with proper relationships)
- ✅ Added default values for JSON fields (`hashtags`, `metadata`)
- ✅ Improved data integrity

#### New Tables
- ✅ **post_media**: Many-to-many relationship between posts and media files
- ✅ **schema_version**: Tracks database schema versions

#### Enhanced Indexes
- ✅ Added performance indexes for all major query patterns
- ✅ Optimized for common filtering and sorting operations

### 2. TypeScript Types Updates

#### New Interfaces
- ✅ `PostMedia`: Represents the relationship between posts and media files
- ✅ `PostTemplate`: Complete interface for post templates
- ✅ Enhanced `Organization` interface with missing fields

#### Updated Interfaces
- ✅ `Post.media`: Now uses `PostMedia[]` instead of `MediaFile[]`
- ✅ All interfaces now match database schema exactly

### 3. Service Layer Refactoring

#### DatabaseService
- ✅ Updated all CRUD operations to work with new schema
- ✅ Added proper media relationship handling
- ✅ Added complete PostTemplate operations
- ✅ Improved error handling and data validation

#### ApiService
- ✅ Added PostTemplate API methods
- ✅ Updated to work with new media relationship structure
- ✅ Enhanced organization management

### 4. Migration System

#### MigrationService
- ✅ Automated schema migration system
- ✅ Data migration for existing post-media relationships
- ✅ Version tracking and rollback capabilities

#### Migration Scripts
- ✅ `migrate-existing-data.js`: Handles existing data migration
- ✅ `test-database-refactor.js`: Comprehensive test suite

## Files Modified

### Core Database Files
- `src/services/database/schema.sql` - Updated schema with new tables and indexes
- `src/services/database/DatabaseService.ts` - Refactored all database operations
- `src/services/database/MigrationService.ts` - New migration system
- `src/services/database/migrations.sql` - Migration scripts

### Type Definitions
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated and added new interfaces

### API Layer
- `src/services/ApiService.ts` - Added PostTemplate operations

### Migration & Testing
- `migrate-existing-data.js` - Data migration script
- `test-database-refactor.js` - Comprehensive test suite

## How to Run the Migration

### 1. Backup Your Data
```bash
# Create a backup of your current database
cp your-database.db backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

### 2. Run the Migration
```bash
# Run the migration script
node migrate-existing-data.js
```

### 3. Test the Migration
```bash
# Run the test suite to verify everything works
node test-database-refactor.js
```

### 4. Verify Your Application
- Start your application
- Test all major features
- Verify that posts with media display correctly
- Check that new post templates work

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Integrity
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Consistent data types and constraints
- ✅ Better error handling

### 2. Performance
- ✅ Optimized indexes for common queries
- ✅ Efficient media relationship queries
- ✅ Reduced data redundancy

### 3. Functionality
- ✅ Complete PostTemplate system
- ✅ Proper media management
- ✅ Enhanced organization features

### 4. Maintainability
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Breaking Changes

### For Developers
1. **Post Media Structure**: Posts now use `PostMedia[]` instead of `MediaFile[]`
2. **Organization Fields**: New optional fields added to Organization interface
3. **Database Queries**: Some queries may need updates for new schema

### For Users
- No breaking changes for end users
- All existing data is preserved and migrated
- Enhanced functionality with post templates

## Testing

The refactor includes comprehensive tests covering:

- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Organization operations
- ✅ Category and topic management
- ✅ Media file operations
- ✅ Post creation and management
- ✅ Post template functionality
- ✅ Calendar operations
- ✅ API service integration

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. **Stop the application**
2. **Restore from backup**:
   ```bash
   cp backup-YYYYMMDD.db your-database.db
   ```
3. **Revert code changes** (if needed)
4. **Restart application**

## Future Enhancements

The new schema supports future enhancements:

- ✅ **Media Optimization**: Better media file management
- ✅ **Post Analytics**: Enhanced tracking capabilities
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Features**: Improved organization isolation
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Better query optimization

## Support

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check the test results in `test-database-refactor.js`
2. Review migration logs in `migrate-existing-data.js`
3. Verify your database backup is valid
4. Check that all dependencies are installed

## Conclusion

This database refactor significantly improves the application's:
- **Data integrity** and consistency
- **Performance** through optimized queries
- **Functionality** with new features
- **Maintainability** with better code structure

The migration process is designed to be safe and reversible, with comprehensive testing to ensure everything works correctly.
