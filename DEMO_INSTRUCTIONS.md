## Milestone 4: Calendar & Scheduling (Days 19-22) ✅ COMPLETED

### Features Implemented:

#### 1. Calendar Component (`src/renderer/components/Calendar.tsx`)
- **Month/Week Views**: Toggle between month and week calendar views
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag scheduled posts to reschedule them
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically detects scheduling conflicts
- **Time Picker**: Click on dates to schedule posts with time selection
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded post status (draft, scheduled, published, failed)
- **Platform Icons**: Visual indicators for different social media platforms

#### 2. Scheduler Component (`src/renderer/components/Scheduler.tsx`)
- **Job Queue Management**: View and manage scheduled jobs
- **Online/Offline Status**: Detects network connectivity
- **Job Statistics**: Real-time stats for queued, scheduled, running, completed, and failed jobs
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Job Status Tracking**: Monitor job execution status

#### 3. Database Integration
- **Scheduled Jobs Table**: New database table for job management
- **Post Scheduling**: Enhanced post table with scheduling capabilities
- **Conflict Resolution**: Database-level conflict detection

#### 4. IPC Communication
- **Calendar API**: `calendar:get-scheduled-posts`
- **Scheduler API**: `scheduler:get-jobs`, `scheduler:add-job`, `scheduler:update-job`, `scheduler:delete-job`

### How to Test:

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Calendar**:
   - Click "Calendar" in the navigation
   - View month/week calendar with scheduled posts
   - Click on dates to schedule new posts
   - Drag posts to reschedule them

3. **Navigate to Scheduler**:
   - Click "Scheduler" in the navigation
   - View job queue and statistics
   - Monitor job execution status
   - Check online/offline status

4. **Test Scheduling**:
   - Create a post in Content Studio
   - Schedule it for a future date/time
   - Verify it appears in both Calendar and Scheduler
   - Test drag-and-drop rescheduling
   - Verify conflict detection works

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ **Schedule posts**: Posts can be scheduled with date/time selection
- ✅ **Reschedule via drag**: Drag-and-drop functionality for rescheduling
- ✅ **Queue posts persist**: Scheduled jobs are stored in database and persist across app restarts
- ✅ **Month/Week views**: Calendar supports both view modes
- ✅ **Conflict detection**: Automatic detection and resolution of scheduling conflicts
- ✅ **Local scheduler**: Background job processing with retry logic

### Technical Implementation:
- **Frontend**: React components with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Electron main process with SQLite database
- **IPC**: Secure communication between renderer and main processes
- **Database**: New `scheduled_jobs` table with foreign key relationships
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Next Steps:
- Integrate with actual social media APIs (Milestone 5)
- Add engagement tracking (Milestone 6)
- Implement analytics dashboard (Milestone 7)
