# Post Management Tab Fix - Test Results

## Issue Fixed
The Post Management tab was not showing posts even though they appeared in the Calendar tab.

## Root Cause
The `DataContext` was trying to access `organization` from `useAuth()`, but the auth context provides `currentOrganization`.

## Fix Applied
Updated `/src/context/DataContext.tsx` to use `currentOrganization` instead of `organization` in all data loading functions.

## What to Test

### 1. Post Management Tab
- Navigate to the Post Management tab
- Verify that posts are now visible (should show the same posts as Calendar tab)
- Test both grid and list view modes
- Verify search functionality works
- Test filtering by category and topic

### 2. Data Synchronization
- Create a new post in Post Management
- Verify it appears in Calendar tab
- Edit a post in Post Management
- Verify changes appear in Calendar tab
- Delete a post in Post Management
- Verify it's removed from Calendar tab

### 3. Performance
- Check that there are no "post loading......" messages in console
- Verify fast loading times
- No repeated database initializations

## Expected Results
âœ… Posts visible in Post Management tab
âœ… Data synchronized between tabs
âœ… Fast loading without console errors
âœ… No repeated database initializations

## If Issues Persist
If posts still don't show up, we can:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database has posts
3. Consider reverting to pre-refactor state
4. Debug the DataContext loading process

## Test Status
ðŸ”„ **Ready for Testing** - Please test the Post Management tab now!
