# CARRY ON DOCUMENT - Social Media Management App

## CURRENT STATUS
**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Database corruption resolved, login working

## PROBLEM SUMMARY
1. **Database has duplicate organizations** - Each organization appears twice with different IDs
2. **No users exist** - User creation failed due to array index mismatch
3. **Login fails** - "User not found" error because no users in database
4. **App stuck in loop** - Keeps trying to create data but fails

## WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED
- Fixed database schema (password_hash vs password column)
- Added user creation logic for each organization
- Tried to prevent data recreation on restart
- Multiple rebuilds and restarts

## CURRENT DATABASE STATE
- **Organizations**: 12 entries (6 duplicates of the 6 intended organizations)
- **Users**: 0 entries (creation failed)
- **Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'orgName')`

## REQUIRED FIXES

### 1. CLEAR CORRUPTED DATABASE
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/social-media-management/
```

### 2. FIX USER CREATION LOGIC
The issue is in `electron/main.ts` around line 185. The `orgCredentials` array has 6 items but `orgResults` has 12 items (duplicates), causing array index mismatch.

**Fix needed**: Either:
- Clear database completely and recreate properly, OR
- Fix the array indexing to handle the duplicate organizations

### 3. SIMPLIFY THE APPROACH
Instead of complex organization selection, create a simple system where:
- Each organization has its own login credentials
- No organization switching needed
- Direct login to specific organization

## LOGIN CREDENTIALS TO CREATE
1. **Karma Cookie**: `karma@karmacookie.com` / `karma123`
2. **Persona Centric**: `persona@personacentric.com` / `persona123`
3. **IMM Limited**: `imm@immlimited.com` / `imm123`
4. **Roleplay**: `roleplay@roleplay.com` / `roleplay123`
5. **HK Foodies**: `foodies@hkfoodies.com` / `foodies123`
6. **1/2 Drinks**: `drinks@halfdrinks.com` / `drinks123`

## FILES TO MODIFY
- `electron/main.ts` - Fix user creation logic
- Database schema is correct, just need to clear and recreate

## QUICK FIX APPROACH
1. Clear database completely
2. Simplify user creation to not depend on organization array indexing
3. Create users directly with hardcoded organization IDs
4. Test login with one organization first

## TERMINAL COMMANDS TO RUN
```bash
# Clear database
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/social-media-management/

# Rebuild and start
npm run build && npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ FINAL RESULTS
- ‚úÖ 6 users created successfully (one per organization)
- ‚úÖ All login credentials working perfectly (100% password match)
- ‚úÖ No more "User not found" errors
- ‚úÖ Data persists between app restarts
- ‚úÖ Duplicate organizations completely removed (6 unique organizations)
- ‚úÖ User-organization mapping corrected
- ‚úÖ Corrupted localStorage session completely cleared
- ‚úÖ Session validation enhanced to prevent future corruption

## USER REQUIREMENT
User wants to be able to login to different organizations with their own databases, without complex organization selection - just direct login to the specific organization.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
1. **Cleared corrupted database** - Removed all duplicate data
2. **Fixed user creation logic** - Changed from array index matching to organization name matching
3. **Added duplicate prevention** - Organizations and users are checked before creation
4. **Fixed corrupted session handling** - Added validation to detect and clear corrupted localStorage sessions
5. **Removed duplicate organizations** - Cleaned up 12 organizations down to 6 unique ones
6. **Fixed user-organization mapping** - Corrected all user-to-organization relationships
7. **Verified login functionality** - All 6 organization credentials work perfectly

## üîß COMPREHENSIVE FIX APPLIED
**Issue**: Corrupted localStorage session + duplicate organizations causing "User not found" error
**Root Cause**: Session had organization ID (25) stored as userId instead of email + 12 duplicate organizations
**Solution**: Complete database cleanup + comprehensive session validation

### üõ°Ô∏è Session Validation Features:
- ‚úÖ Validates session structure and data types
- ‚úÖ Ensures userId is an email address (not organization ID)
- ‚úÖ Ensures organizationId is a string (not number)
- ‚úÖ Automatically clears corrupted sessions on detection
- ‚úÖ Prevents future session corruption issues

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Cleanup Features:
- ‚úÖ Removed 6 duplicate organizations (kept oldest of each)
- ‚úÖ Fixed all user-organization mappings
- ‚úÖ Verified all login credentials work correctly
- ‚úÖ Maintained data integrity throughout cleanup

---
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - Database cleaned, duplicates removed, login working perfectly!
